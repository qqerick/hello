OPERATING PROCEDURES (NORMAL OPERATION)\n8.1 Pre-Operation Checks\n- Verify current status in the BMS: AHU status, fan running status, damper positions, supply/return pressures, temperature setpoints.\n- Confirm area around duct/workspace is clear; ensure access routes are unobstructed.\n- Check for any visible insulation damage, duct leaks, or corrosion; note issues for PM.\n\n8.2 Start-Up\n- If AHU and associated fans are not running, enable through BMS per approved sequence (start from the master controller, allow ramp time).\n- Confirm upstream and downstream dampers for the duct are aligned with design positions (as per S.O.P. or sequence of operations). Make adjustments only via BMS or manual controls if authorized.\n- Validate airflow in the duct segment with an airflow meter; ensure airflow direction matches design intent.\n- Check for abnormal noises, vibrations, or leaks; address as per PM guidelines.\n\n8.3 Normal Operation Monitoring\n- Monitor temperature differential, pressure differential, vibration levels, and noise during operation.\n- Record readings at prescribed intervals in the asset log.\n- If deviations occur, follow fault-handling steps in the Troubleshooting section or contact the MEP Supervisor.\n\n8.4 Daily/Weekly Logging\n- Log operation status, damper positions, any alarms, unusual conditions, and any corrective actions taken.\n- Ensure BMS alarms are acknowledged and routed to the control team.\n\n9. MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES\n9.1 Preventive Maintenance (PM) Schedule\n- Frequency: As per PM plan (e.g., monthly visual inspection; quarterly damper/actuator verification; semi-annual duct cleaning and insulation check; annual full system review).\n- Consider more frequent checks after major events (e.g., renovations, high dust periods).\n\n9.2 Visual Inspection\n- Inspect duct surfaces for corrosion, dents, loose insulation, holes, or sealant degradation.\n- Inspect hangers, supports, and vibration isolation for security and condition.\n- Inspect damper linkages, actuators, limit switches, and control wiring for wear or damage.\n\n9.3 Damper and Actuator Verification\n- Manually verify that dampers fully close and fully open. For motorized dampers, operate through full travel cycle via BMS or local switch.\n- Check actuator torque, travel time, and feedback signals; compare to manufacturer specifications.\n- Inspect limit switches and position indicators; recalibrate if out of spec.\n\n9.4 Duct Cleaning and Sealing\n- Schedule duct cleaning by qualified contractor per PM specification.\n- Inspect and replace seals/gaskets as needed; reseal joints showing leakage.\n- Insulate exposed duct sections if insulation degradation is evident.\n\n9.5 Insulation and Surface Integrity\n- Check insulation thickness, moisture intrusion, and surface condition; repair as required.\n- Treat any corrosion-prone areas per approved guidelines.\n\n9.6 Post-Maintenance Verification\n- Re-run BMS sequence; confirm airflow, damper positions, and system responsiveness.\n- Document maintenance actions, parts replaced, and any calibration corrections.\n\n9.7 Documentation\n- Record PM date, personnel, findings, corrective actions, and next PM due date.\n- Save updated drawings or control sequences if changes were made.\n\n10. EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF PROCEDURES\n10.1 Triggering Situations\n- Fire, smoke, gas leakage, significant duct or damper malfunction, electrical fault with risk to personnel, or any condition requiring immediate isolation of the duct asset.\n\n10.2 Immediate Actions (FAST RESPONSE)\n- Raise alarm and notify facilities management and security. If life safety is involved, call emergency services.\n- Evacuate area if required; ensure safe clearance from the immediate duct path.\n\n10.3 Isolation Steps\n- Identify and isolate energy sources:\n  - Electrical: Access the electrical disconnects feeding the AHU and any associated fans serving this duct. Use LOTO to lock out and tag out the disconnects before proceeding.\n  - Mechanical: Close all motorized dampers controlling the duct segment via the BMS or local control panels to the fully closed position.\n- If safe to do so, manually close any redundant dampers that feed into or out of the affected duct segment, ensuring safe access and minimal exposure.\n\n10.4 Verification of Isolation\n- Confirm there is no airflow in the duct segment using airflow measurement tools or BMS status indicators.\n- Verify that all energy sources are physically isolated and tagged.\n\n10.5 Communications and Safety\n- Notify control room, facilities management, and safety officer of the shutdown.\n- Post hazard signage and restrict access to the area until clearance is given.\n- If conditions indicate fire or hazardous atmosphere, follow fire/safety protocols and do not re-enter until cleared by fire or safety personnel.\n\n10.6 Post-Event actions\n- Document the incident: time, location, cause, actions taken, personnel involved, and any damages.\n- Notify relevant parties for a formal incident review.\n- Initiate corrective actions to prevent recurrence (repair, parts replacement, control sequence update).\n\n10.7 Recommissioning (After Hazard Clearance)\n- Only after clearance from safety and facilities must you perform a controlled re-energization.\n- Remove LOTO devices only after all work is complete and the area is safe.\n- Re-energize the AHU and associated fans in stages, verifying damper positions and airflow at each step.\n- Monitor for normal operation for a defined stabilization period; document results and return to normal operation logs.\n\n11. LOCKOUT/TAGOUT (LOTO) PROCEDURE\n- Obtain authorization from the MEP Supervisor before initiating LOTO.\n- Identify all energy sources feeding the HVAC duct asset (electrical, mechanical, pneumatic controls).\n- Apply Lockout devices and attach tags clearly indicating the asset, date, reason, and responsible person.\n- Verify isolation by attempting to re-energize controls and by measuring absence of voltage and absence of mechanical motion as applicable.\n- Keep LOTO devices in place until the asset is re-commissioned and all work is completed; remove only after supervisor approval.\n\n12. RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION\n- Maintain an asset log with: operation status, PM dates, inspections, damper/actuator tests, cleaning actions, any deviations, LOTO events, and emergency shutdowns.\n- Attach drawing updates, sequence changes, and approved procedures to the asset record.\n- Retain incident reports and corrective action follow-ups for audit.\n\n13. TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS\n- All personnel must complete training on: normal operation, PM procedures, LOTO, confined spaces, fall protection (where applicable), using BMS controls, and emergency response.\n- Periodic refreshers and drills must be conducted per the security and safety schedule.\n\n14. AUDIT AND REVIEW\n- The SOP shall be reviewed annually or after significant changes to the duct asset, control sequences, or after an incident.\n- Updates must be approved by the Facility Manager and communicated to all affected personnel.\n\n15.
